Tee-Shirt Robot
======
Code to drive Team 3140's PR t-shirt cannon robot. The robot uses the following:
- Mecanum drivetrain to move around
- A custom CAM-wheel system to elevate the cannons
- Three super-fast solenoids to shoot over 25 shots quickly from a single fueling ( to 120 PSI )
- Custom lights provided by ~~an Arduino~~ the roboRio

## TO-DO LIST
- [x] Create repository, README, and .gitignore
- [x] Full mecanum-functionality complete
- [ ] Transitioned to ***F***ield ***O***riented ***D***rive (probably broken on refactor -- TBD)
- [x] Shooter code finished
- [x] Refactor to 2021 code standards
- [ ] Test that all systems (except pitch control) still function after refactor
- [ ] Implement proximity sensor based safety lockout features
- [ ] Implement LED warning feature
- [ ] Restore pitch control (via d-pad?)
